# VOICE-TO-VOICE-AI-TRANSLATION
A voice-to-voice translator is a technology that enables real-time translation of spoken language from one language to another. It typically uses automatic speech recognition (ASR) to convert spoken words into text, followed by machine translation (MT) to translate the text into the target language.
